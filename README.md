### CS4033 - Homework 1
- Run `main.py` to see the algorithims run.
- The majority of the assignment has been split into different files.
- I attempted to follow the pseudo-code given by the textbook for the algorithms, hence the `Problem` class (`problem.py`). This class was used to determine the start and goal with helper functions (total path cost for example)
- The Romania adjacency list is in `romania.py`. The SLD heuristic given by the textbook is in `heuristics.py`. I planned to have the other two heuristics implemented in the same file but, do what you wish.
- Each search function is in it's own file as well:
    - `a_star.py`: A*
    - `bfs.py`: Breadth-First Search 
    - `dfs.py`: Depth-First Search
    - `greedy.py`: Greedy Best-First Search
- For "Implementation Details" section of "Report and Analysis" on the homework document, all 4 of these algorithms were implementation based off of the pseudocode the book provided. Other sources I used:
    - https://cs.stanford.edu/people/abisee/gs.pdf
    - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/a-search-algorithm/
    - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/greedy-best-first-search-algorithm/
- Each of these are imported into `main.py` to easily test. It holds examples of how to run each algorithm for different problems.
